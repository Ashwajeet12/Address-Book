# Address-Book
A command-line Address Book application written in C. This project allows users to manage contacts with essential operations like create, search, edit, delete, and list. Each contact is composed of a name, a phone number, and an email address, with built-in validation to ensure entries are well-formatted and unique.

Features:
Add new contacts with validation for name, phone, and email
Search contacts by name, phone number, or email, with support for refined results
Edit existing contacts with duplicate prevention
Delete selected contacts after confirmation
List all contacts in a well-formatted table
Save and load contacts from a CSV file to preserve data between runs

Usage:
Compile the program with a C compiler (e.g., gcc)
On running, a menu is presented to interact with your address book
Instructions and prompts guide every part of the process
Ideal for beginners wanting a practical C project, and extendable for more advanced features in the future.
